# DriverAnalytics

Application designed to collect drivers data for collection of driving behaviors to train future machine learning/Deep Learning models.

## Current Phone sensor data collected stored to local database (If sensor is available on phone)
- Light Sensor (Currently only sensor displayed to UI)
- Accelerometer
- Gyroscope
- Magnometer
- Barometer
- Gravity Sensor
- Heading Sensor
- Ambient Temperature
- Relative Humidity

## OBD-II Data
Not yet implemented

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] display Sensor Data from screen
- [ ] implement settings for app.
- [ ] data exportation for model training.
- [ ] connect to OBD-II 
- [ ] Limit sensor data collection during driving activity only.
- [ ] Implement GPS location tracking as seperate data collection
